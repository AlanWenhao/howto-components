Tab panels are a pattern to limit visible content by separating
it into multiple panels. Only one panel is visible at a time, while
_all_ corresponding tabs are always visible. To switch from one panel
to another, the corresponding tab has to be selected.

By either clicking or by using the arrow keys the user changes the
selection of the active tab.

If JavaScript is disabled, all panels are shown interleaved with the
respective tabs. The tabs now function as headings.
