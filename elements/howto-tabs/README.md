## Summary {: #summary }

`<howto-tabs>` limit visible content by separating it into multiple panels. Only
one panel is visible at a time, while _all_ corresponding tabs are always
visible. To switch from one panel to another, the corresponding tab has to be
selected.

By either clicking or by using the arrow keys the user can change the
selection of the active tab.

If JavaScript is disabled, all panels are shown interleaved with the
respective tabs. The tabs now function as headings.
