A tooltip is a popup that displays information related to an element
when the element receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.
It typically appears after a small delay and disappears when Escape is
pressed or on mouse out. The element that triggers the tooltip references
the tooltip element with aria-describedby.
