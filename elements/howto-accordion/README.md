Accordions are a pattern to limit visible content by separating
it into multiple panels. Any panel can be expanded or collapsed, giving
the user control over which content is visible.

By either clicking or by using the arrow keys the user changes the
selection of the active heading. With enter or space the active headings
can be toggled between expanded and collapsed state.

The headings and the panels have the classes `expanded` or `collapsed`
assigned to them depending on their state.

All panels should be styled to be visible if JavaScript is disabled.
